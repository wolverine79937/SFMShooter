/* This is my version history file.
*
*  0.0.0 (12/25/2022): This was the initial pre-prototype of my game. It was nothing but a circle that the player could
*                      move around the screen with the A, W, S and D keys.
*
*  0.0.1 (12/26/2022): Finally got rid of that ugly green circle and replaced it with a neat jet sprite. I really couldn't
*                      tollerate that green circle much longer. LOL.
